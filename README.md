# Delivery-Workers-Finder
The delivery workers finder is an app that permits an administrator of a restaurant/shop or any type of business that does deliveries and shipping, to find and register the nearest delivery worker based on the coordenates of the new order and the ones of the delivery workers in a parametrized map. It also gives the possibility to the administrator to search  previous deliveries.
